# calc_days_with_js

This is just a simple project for anyone who is finding it difficult to learn JS.
You can use this pratice with it, modify it and make it yours.
This is just for educational purpose only, it's not a big project or anything

I like commenting on my code, so there are comments on the app.js file to help you understand the code well.

Thanks!
